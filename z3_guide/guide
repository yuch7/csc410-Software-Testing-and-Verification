Z3 functions and python functions

Z3 arrays and python arrays
  select, store


basics
  booleans: And, Or, Implies, Not (can apply to lists or arbitrary args)
  arithmetic: +, -, reals, sqrt


getting around the lack of recursion in Z3 by using a python function to build a constraint (occurences)
some functions still apply (sum)
creating variables arrays, vars for quantifiers

useful functions
  sum (a python function, but works because f override)
  Distinct
  ForAll, Exists
  div (/)
  mod (%)

models
  indexing
  eval
